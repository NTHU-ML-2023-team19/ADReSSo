# ADReSSo

This is the repo for the codes to fine-tuning the transformers with the [ADReSSo dataset](https://dementia.talkbank.org/ADReSSo-2021/). The dataset has been converted into [Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nevikw39/ADReSSo).

Our goal is to resolve the first, classification task in the [2021 ADReSSo Challenge](https://luzs.gitlab.io/adresso-2021/) at [2021 INTERSPEECH](https://www.interspeech2021.org/special-sessions-challenges).

## Hyper-parameters Tuning Guide

$$\text{Equivalent Batch Size}=\\#\text{GPUs}\times\text{Batch Size Per GPU}\times\text{Gradient Accumulation Steps}$$

So if the model fails to fit in the GPU, i.e., CUDA out of memory, try to decrease $\text{Batch Size Per GPU}$ while $\text{Gradient Accumulation Steps}$ incresed simultaneously. In this manner, we trade off time for space.
